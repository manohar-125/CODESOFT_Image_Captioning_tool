# 🖼 Image Captioning using Transformers

## 📌 Objective
Develop an AI-powered system that automatically generates meaningful textual captions for images by integrating Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## ⚙️ Tech Used
- Python
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Pre-trained vit-gpt2-image-captioning model
- PyTorch
- Google Colab

## 🧠 Features
- Upload any image and receive a relevant caption generated automatically
- Utilizes a Vision Transformer (ViT) as encoder and GPT-2 as decoder
- Clean and efficient implementation in a Colab notebook
- Works with real-world images of various categories—objects, people, animals, and more

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the file task3_image_captioning.ipynb in Google Colab
2. Run all code cells step-by-step
3. Upload your image as prompted
4. The system will generate a caption for your image
