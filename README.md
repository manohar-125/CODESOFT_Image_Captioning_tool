# 🖼️ Task 3 – Image Captioning using Transformers (CodSoft AI Internship)

This project is part of the **Artificial Intelligence Internship** offered by **CodSoft**.

## 📌 Objective
Create an AI-powered system that generates a meaningful **textual caption** for a given image by combining **Computer Vision (CV)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

## ⚙️ Tech Used
- Python
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Pre-trained `vit-gpt2-image-captioning` model
- PyTorch
- Google Colab

## 🧠 Features
- Upload any image and get a relevant caption generated automatically
- Uses a powerful **Vision Transformer (ViT)** as encoder and **GPT-2** as decoder
- Clean and efficient implementation in a Colab notebook
- Supports real-world images of objects, people, animals, etc.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the file `task3_image_captioning.ipynb` in **Google Colab**
2. Run all code cells step-by-step
3. Upload your own image when prompted
4. Get a caption generated by the model
